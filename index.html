								<p> 1) <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GlG-mkx0_Y945vruGSpO55LzJy-CGmHk9Fb4A-Mc8Dk/edit#slide=id.g11d5609459a_0_86">Digital Nomads</a> <br>
									In this project, my objective was to provide new destination recommendations within the US for potential digital nomads at the county level.
									I use K-means to cluster all of the counties in The US into distinct 
									groups and explore the significance of different silhouette scores and cluster sizes in the process as a potential basis for recommending new regions to potential nomads.
									Visualizations of the clusters and key data points from each county and cluster can be found in 
									this<a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/airton.tatoug.kamdem/viz/county_tb/Dashboard1?publish=yes"> Tableau Dashboard.</a>
									Ultimately, since even the best silhouette score was relatively low (.4), the better approach towards making reliable recommendations was through plotting all of the counties along with the 200+ 
									features (gender, diversity, broadband access etc.) associated with each, and using Eucledian distances to return the counties closest to the ones that a user prefers.
									I deployed this strategy through this <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/akamdem/counties/main/app.py"> Web Application </a> -- feel free to enter your US county and explore! (or try mine: Montgomery County, Maryland).

								</p>
								<p> 2) <a href="https://github.com/akamdem/digital-literacy-project">Digital Media Literacy</a> <br>
									Digital literacy continues to be a challenging issue in The US, particularly for communities that are not native English speakers, as 
									it can be more difficult for them to pickup the nuances and contextual patterns behind the deluge of social and digital media posts
									claiming legitimacy, while masking conspiracy theories behind the guise of credible journalism. In this project, I sought to provide 
									an initial layer of defense for these communities by taking inputs from users in the form of text (social media posts, headlines etc.), vectorizing the text,
									and applying a trained Natural Language Processing model to classify the given post/headline as something that either
									resembles thousands of other credible news media posts, or rather conspirary theory posts that have been pulled and analysed through Reddit's PushShift API. 
									Along with the initial classification, the model also outputs the probability behind its determination, providing users with this additional datapoints
									to inform further investigation into the credibility of a post or headline -- click <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/akamdem/misinfo/main/app.py">here to explore my NLP Web Application</a>
								</p>

								<p> 3) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gpa/case-studies/2021-06-11-cdc-ad-council">Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) Media Partnership</a> <br>
									The case study linked above highlights the result of the partnership that Airton guided for 20 months as a Partner Manager at Meta(Facebook). In this partnership, Airton
									managed Meta's advertising relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the Covid-19 Pandemic, helping the company and US government 
									respond to the public health crisis by promoting the presence of accurate health information
									across the united states through Meta platforms. Airton, the Ad Council, and the CDC ultimately served billions of impressions to over 80% of the US population, and after designing measurement approaches
									to quantify the impact of this effort, this case study was published to highlight key results from a few of the campaigns Airton designed, showcasing a 3 point increase in 
									18 - 34 year olds' willingess to wear masks, and a 2 point increase in this group's perception of the importance of masks at a 99% confidence level, equating to over 4 million people's perceptions
									being shifted on this topic through the highlighted campaigns alone. 
								</p>

								<p> 4) <a href="https://github.com/akamdem/walkability-project">Walkability & Air Quality in California</a> <br>
									This was a team project using EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and open air quality data to provide guidance to families hoping to relocate to and within the largest metropolitan areas of california. 
									In this project, I wrangled EPA data, concatenated this with air quality data pulled through an open API maintained by a company called Purple Air, 
									and I used Python(Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib) to clean the data, visualize the correlations between different factors (employment rate, density etc.) and the patterns/trends observable accross these key features in the concatenated dataset.
									Our team of data analyst then developed and evaluated a set of regression models that predict the Air Quality of the Los Angeles, 
									Sacramento, and San Francisco throughout the year based on the most highly correlated features (income, temperature etc.).  
								</p>
								<p> 5) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/success/stewart-hotel#">Facebook Dynamic Ads</a> <br>
									The case study linked above highlights the result of Airton's partnership with several businesses accross the Travel Industry, where he unlocked a new level
									of product adoption for the company's most profitable advertising product.
									Airton identified a gap in product adoption, namely tied to a lack of data being shared across the marketing funnel, he directed customer surveys and 
									product analysis to confirm his hypothesis, and identified key players in industry that could help him and Facebook address the blocker in product adoption.
									In partnership with a digital media agency, and a booking engine company, Airton was able to build a small case for these partners to expand the reach and 
									application of Facebook's pixel and Dynamic Ads to their heavily trafficed domains, demonstrating the potential value add for each of these partners along the way.
									Having proven success at a small scale, Airton partnered with team leads, PMs and PMMs to launch the public case study linked above and provide a 
									model for the rest of the industry to unlock this key product,
									opening up $10+ million dollar a year in revenue for Facebook, as the expanded usage of the Facebook Pixel and Dynamic Ads products
									helped dozens of businesses achieve results such as the ones noted in this case study -- 50x return on ad spend, 82% decrease in cost per transaction. The study was
									published <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/success/stewart-hotel#">here</a> by the proud clients as well.

								<p> 1) <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/akamdem/misinfo/main/app.py">Digital Literacy Application:</a> <br>
								<br>This Application promotes digital media literacy in communities that are less familiar with english. The app scrapes over 5000 posts from 
								the r/worldnews subreddit and r/conspiracy subreddit, vectorizes the text, and trains a
								Naïve Bayes model on these posts to identify linguistic patterns behind credible news post/headlines and
								those that are more likely to be stemming from conspiracy theories. The app then takes in new inputs from users and
								predicts a classification based on the NLP model's training, returning a probability for either class predicted.
</p>

								<p> 2) <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/akamdem/counties/main/app.py">Digital Nomads Application:</a> <br>
								<br>This Application recommends new destinations in the United States for potential digital nomads.
								It plots 3141 US counties and uses Eucledian distances to return a recommendation closest to the one submitted by the user
								to help them identify a domestic region most similar to county they're already fond of. This App is also
								accompanied by a public <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/airton.tatoug.kamdem/viz/county_tb/Dashboard1?publish=yes"> Tableau Dashboard</a> 
								that visualizes key data points (median age, income etc) about each county, and clusters of 
								counties as calculated through K-means clustering with a peak silhouette score of around .4 and cluster size of 49.
